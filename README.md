The training set and test set are given in the folders as named.
Here, MNIST Fashion Class dataset used which contains 70000 images;

1. 60000 for training
2. 10000 for testing

Images are 28*28 grayscale images. Each image is represented by a single row in the dataset with 28*28 = 784 pixel values present in the 784 columns.

The 10 target classes are as follows:

0 => T-shirt/top 1 => Trouser 2 => Pullover 3 => Dress 4 => Coat 5 => Sandal 6 => Shirt 7 => Sneaker 8 => Bag 9 => Ankle boot

Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255.

Go through the jupyter notebook file for the code which has a clear visualization of the dataset used.
